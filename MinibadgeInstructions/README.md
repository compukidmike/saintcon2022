## Soldering Instructions

1. The magnet makes the badge a little difficult to solder as your iron will likely be attracted to it. To make it easier, place the minibadge on a holder and place the pins through it into the holder. This will keep it from moving around while you solder it.

2. Solder the resistors to R1 and R2. Then solder the left side of the solder jumpers JP1 and JP2.

3. Solder one side of the flex circuit to the back of the minibadge. It should be soldered near the outside edge of the minibadge. The flex circuit should be face-up so that it's the correct way when you fold it over the other side of the minibadge.

4. Wrap the flex circuit around the front of the minibadge and solder the other side.

5. Flip the minibadge over and solder the 2-pin headers to the back of the minibadge.

6. Gently pinch the ends of the flex circuit so that the circle is ~1mm from the magnet.

7. When properly adjusted, the heart should move slightly in and out.
